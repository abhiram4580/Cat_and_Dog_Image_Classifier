# Cat-Dog Classifier with InceptionResNetV2 and Streamlit
## Overview:
The Cat-Dog Classifier is now equipped with a sleek frontend using Streamlit, making it even more accessible and interactive. Powered by the advanced InceptionResNetV2 model, this project allows users to effortlessly identify whether a given image features a cat or a dog. Ideal for both beginners and enthusiasts, it brings the excitement of pet recognition to your fingertips.

## How it Works:

#### InceptionResNetV2 Magic: 
At the heart of our system is InceptionResNetV2, a cutting-edge model adept at recognizing intricate patterns in images. Its pre-trained capabilities enhance the accuracy of pet identification.
#### Streamlit Frontend:
We've integrated Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface. Simply upload an image, and the model instantly reveals whether it's a cat or a dog. No coding required!
Matplotlib Insights: Visualize model performance with Matplotlib directly in the Streamlit app for a comprehensive overview.
Dataset:

#### This project uses the "Dogs and Cats" dataset obtained from Kaggle. You can find the dataset here.

### Getting Started:

Curate Your Collection: Assemble a diverse set of cat and dog pictures. The more, the merrier!
Install Dependencies: Execute pip install -r requirements.txt to set up the required components.
Initiate Training: Train the model with your curated images using the train.py script.
Streamlit Deployment: Run the Streamlit app with streamlit run app.py to launch the frontend. Visit http://localhost:8501 in your browser to interact with the classifier.
Example:

```bash
  streamlit run app.py
```
#### Customization Options:

Adjust the model parameters in train.py for fine-tuning.
Modify the Streamlit app in app.py to enhance the user interface.
